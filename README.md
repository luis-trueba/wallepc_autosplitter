# wallepc_autosplitter
An autosplitter + load removing script for the WALL-E video game. 

This autosplitter currently has load removal in it! Load removing has NOT been approved for leaderboard submissions yet, so make sure your timer is set to "real time" when you submit! I will make this a checkbox defaulting to False in the near future
